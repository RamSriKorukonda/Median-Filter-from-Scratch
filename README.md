# Median-Filter-from-Scratch
Creating a Median Filter for denoising the images from scratch using Python


Median filtering is a nonlinear process useful in reducing impulsive, or salt-and-pepper noise


Store the pixel values of input image in an array.

For each pixel value store all the neighbor pixel value including that cell in a new array (called temp).

Sort the temp array.

Median of temp array is used to store output image pixel intensity.

The screenshot of output is saved as output.jpeg
