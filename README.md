# Median-Filter-from-Scratch
Creating a Median Filter for denoising the images from scratch using Python


Median filtering is a nonlinear process useful in reducing impulsive, or salt-and-pepper noise


Store the pixel values of input image in an array.
For each pixel value store all the neighbor pixel value including that cell in a new array (called window).
Sort the window array.
Median of window array is used to store output image pixel intensity.
